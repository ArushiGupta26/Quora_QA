# Quora_QA
Quora Question Answer Dataset (Quora-QuAD) contains 56,402 question-answer pairs scraped from Quora. I have fine tuned Flan-T5 and BART for closed-book question answering using the above question-answer pairs scraped from Quora. 
Note: The model notebooks can be run on Kaggle and code to train BERT and GPT2 models have been provided for reference (not included in results) and will be implemented in future.
