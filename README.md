Quora Question Answer Dataset (Quora-QuAD) contains 56,402 question-answer pairs scraped from Quora. I have fine tuned Flan-T5 and BART for closed-book question answering using small subsets of the above question-answer pairs scraped from Quora. They will be fine-tuned on the entire data in the future.
Note: The model notebooks can be run on a standard Kaggle notebook and requirements can be seen accordingly. Requrements for running Streamlit and Notebook 1 are provided. Additionally, the code to train BERT and GPT2 models have been provided for reference (not included in results) and will be implemented in future.
